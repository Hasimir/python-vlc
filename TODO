* Add more test coverage
* Provide more examples
* Investigate memory management

* Support multiple VLC versions: define a front-end module which will
   load the appropriate versioned module from a subdirectory.
** This is now available in the dist directory (stand alone zips
    should be made from it for the website).
** Take advantage of path discovery processes in frontend to reduce the
    dll and dylib search clutter in the actual module files.
